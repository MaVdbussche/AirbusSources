This is the github repository for the CrossProc Android app. It is called AirbusSources as this was the name I originaly gaved to the app, and I haven't changed it then.
This app was created using Android Studio, as well as an SQLite manager for creating the database.

I am aware my code is quite messy and class names are clearly questionable, but please be aware that I made this as a unexperienced java  programmer, during my free time. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions regarding my code.

I am aware not much of this app's code will be reusable, but still thought it might be useful to you to have access to this repository, so here it is.

In case you were wondering, Pietlafrite and MaVdbussche are my two Github accounts, that I used indifferently.

Here is my e-mail address in case you have any questions :
